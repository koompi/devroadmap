# KOOMPI OS

We, people, spend at least 30% of our life time in front of screens like mobiles, tablets, and computers to learn, explore, work, and entertain. As a consequence, **UX/UI** is very critical for our success and happiness. Bad **UX/UI** wastes our time which is the most valuable thing for all of us.

**KOOMPI** does pay attentions to every detail of lives. Our mission is to provide the tools for future engineer, dicoverers, and problem solvers. In short, it is about the success of humanity, so offering **the best UX/UI** is one of our greatest commitment. That is why **KOOMPI OS** ever exists. Every experience about our platform, **KOOMPI OS**, must be **simple, beautiful, fast, smooth, and secure**.

Moreover, We want both users and developers to be happy. Great products always come with great challenges. **Developing applications** on our platform is as easy as learning ABC. We offer the best **SDK and API** for developers to create and deploy their apps. All APIs come with step by step tutorials and examples, so all developers can start and join our ship quickly.

**Community contributors** either as forum helpers, article authors, tutorial makers, developers making free and opensource apps, or even users will get rewards from **KOOMPI Community Incentization Program**, so join us now and let's grow together.
